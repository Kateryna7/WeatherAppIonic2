# Ionic 2 Weather App
Ionic 2 is a popular front-end JavaScript framework for developing cross-platform mobile apps using Apache Cordova. The Ionic 2 Framework gives Cordova applications a native look and feel, and automatically adjusts that look across platforms. 

I have used Visual Studio 2015 and Ripple Emulator to easily create and debug cross-platform Ionic 2 app. This is Ionic 2 version of the Weather App.
